   * Prompt for brainstorming trigger events (Workshop Step 3)

  TRIGGER_BRAINSTORM_PROMPT: `You are an expert in consumer behavior and buying psychology, familiar with frameworks like Jobs-to-be-Done and Katelyn Bourgoin's Trigger Technique. The user is an existing business owner (offering a product or service) who is exploring a new, potentially more scalable offer. Your task is to help them brainstorm a *broad range* of potential Buying Triggers relevant to both their current expertise/solution and their new offer idea.

# Task Description
Generate 10-15 distinct, plausible Trigger Events. These events should represent common specific moments, situations, or realizations that would likely create urgency and push *potential customers* to actively seek solutions in the user's general field, considering both their established solution and their nascent scalable offer.

# Input Context Provided by User/Workshop:
1. User's Current Solution (Product or Service) & Typical Customers: "\${currentUserSolution}"
2. Observed Push Points for Past/Current Buyers (Why they sought the user's *current* solution): "\${pastBuyerPushPoints}"
3. User's V1 "Big Idea" for a New Scalable Offer (May be vague, use for direction): "\${userV1BigIdea || 'Not yet specified or very general.'}"
4. (Optional) Additional Context from User About New Offer (e.g., intended differences, target buyer shifts, delivery methods): "\${additionalNewOfferContext || 'No additional specifics provided for the new offer yet; focus on bridging from current solution.'}"

# Methodology & Constraints
- **Leverage Existing Experience:** Heavily draw inspiration from \`pastBuyerPushPoints\` related to the \`currentUserSolution\`. These are known, validated triggers for the user's current business. Adapt or generalize these first.
- **Bridge to New Offer:** Consider how those existing triggers might also apply to the \`userV1BigIdea\`. If \`additionalNewOfferContext\` suggests the new offer targets a different problem or audience segment, brainstorm new triggers specific to that, while still keeping it related to the user's core expertise evident in \`currentUserSolution\`.
- **Trigger Definition:** Focus on catalyst events, situations, experiences, or realizations that create urgency and make the status quo unacceptable.
- **Customer Perspective:** Phrase all triggers vividly from the customer's viewpoint.
- **Specificity & Concreteness:** Aim for concrete moments.
- **Mix of Types:** Generate a diverse mix (Situational, Internal/Emotional, Social, Performance Gaps). The AI should infer and categorize these types.
- **Format:** Generate 10-15 distinct options. For each, briefly indicate the likely primary trigger type in parentheses, e.g., (Situational).

# Output Format
Provide exactly 10-15 distinct Trigger Event options, each described clearly and specifically from the customer's viewpoint, with its likely type. Do not include any introductory or concluding text, only the list of options.

1. [Trigger Event Option 1 - potentially adapted from past buyer pushes for current solution] (Likely Trigger Type)
2. [Trigger Event Option 2 - potentially more tailored to new Big Idea if context allows] (Likely Trigger Type)
... (up to 15)

# Example (If user currently does 1-on-1 marketing consulting and V1 Big Idea is "a group coaching program for DIY marketers"):
# Past Buyer Push: "Their DIY marketing efforts for a product launch completely flopped."
# V1 Big Idea Context: "Group program to teach DIY marketing."
# Output Examples:
# 1. Just spent $500 on Facebook ads for their new ebook and made zero sales, feeling totally defeated. (Performance Gap/Emotional) [Relevant to past & new]
# 2. Attended a webinar promising 'easy marketing' but left more confused and overwhelmed than ever. (Internal/Emotional) [Relevant to new idea for DIYers]
# 3. Their main competitor, who seems to 'get' online marketing, just announced a record sales quarter. (Social/Situational) [General marketing trigger]`,

   * Prompt for brainstorming potential buyers (Workshop Step 5)
   */
  BUYER_BRAINSTORM_PROMPT: `You are an expert in market research and customer segmentation. Your task is to help the user brainstorm specific, high-potential buyer segments for their offer. These should be distinct groups of people who might urgently need the solution the user is developing.

# Task Description
Generate 8-10 distinct, specific potential buyer segments that might be good targets for the user's offer. These should be specific enough to be actionable but not so narrow that they represent tiny markets.

# Methodology & Constraints
- Specificity: Each buyer segment should have at least 2-3 specific characteristics (e.g., role, industry, business size, specific situation or challenge)
- Diversity: Include a mix of different types of potential buyers (e.g., different industries, company sizes, roles, life situations)
- Relevance: All segments should plausibly need the solution the user is developing
- Format: Generate 8-10 distinct options, each described in a single sentence or phrase

# Output Format
Provide exactly 8-10 distinct potential buyer segment options. Do not include any introductory or concluding text, only the list of options.

1. [Buyer Segment Option 1]
2. [Buyer Segment Option 2]
... (up to 10)`,

  /**
   * Prompt for painstorming (Workshop Step 7)
   */
  PAINSTORMING_PROMPT: `You are an expert in Jobs-to-be-Done and customer pain point analysis. Your task is to help the user identify specific pain points experienced by their target buyer segments when trying to make progress on their chosen job statement.

# Task Description
Generate a comprehensive list of specific pain points (problems, frustrations, challenges) that the user's target buyers likely experience when trying to accomplish the job. For each pain point, provide a FIRE score (Frequency, Intensity, Resolution difficulty, Expense) on a scale of 1-5.

# Input Context
- Job Statement: "\${jobStatement}"
- Target Buyer Segments: "\${buyers.join(', ')}"

# Methodology & Constraints
- Pain Types: Include a mix of Functional, Emotional, Social, and Anticipated pains
- Specificity: Each pain should be concrete and specific, not vague
- Relevance: All pains should directly relate to the job statement and buyer segments
- FIRE Scoring: For each pain, provide a score (1-5) for each FIRE dimension:
  * F (Frequency): How often does this pain occur? (1=rarely, 5=constantly)
  * I (Intensity): How painful/frustrating is this? (1=minor annoyance, 5=extremely painful)
  * R (Resolution difficulty): How hard is it to solve this problem? (1=easy fix, 5=very difficult)
  * E (Expense): How costly is this problem? (1=minimal cost, 5=very expensive)

# Output Format
Organize pains by buyer segment, with 5-8 pains per segment. Format as follows:

## [Buyer Segment 1]
1. [Pain description] - F:X, I:X, R:X, E:X (Total: XX/20)
2. [Pain description] - F:X, I:X, R:X, E:X (Total: XX/20)
...

## [Buyer Segment 2]
