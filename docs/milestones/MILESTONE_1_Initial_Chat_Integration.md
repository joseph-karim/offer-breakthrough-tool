# Milestone 1: Initial Chat Integration & Core Architecture

**Date:** 2024-07-27

## Goals Achieved:

- **Shift to Chat-Centric Architecture:** Refactored the application to use a chat interface as the primary interaction model for workshop steps.
- **Core Component Implementation:**
    - Created `ChatInterface` for managing chat interactions.
    - Created `ChatMessage` for displaying individual messages.
    - Created `SuggestionCard` for displaying AI suggestions.
- **AI Service Integration:**
    - Implemented `AIService` to handle communication with OpenAI.
    - Implemented `OpenAIService` as a wrapper for the `openai` library.
    - Integrated structured JSON output generation for various steps (Anti-Goals, Trigger Events, Jobs, Markets, Problems, Market Evaluation, Offer Exploration).
- **State Management Update:**
    - Updated `useWorkshopStore` (Zustand) to manage chat history (`stepChats`), suggestions (`currentSuggestion`), and related actions (`addChatMessage`, `acceptSuggestion`).
    - Aligned `WorkshopData` type with the new chat and suggestion structures.
- **Summary & Action Plan Step:**
    - Implemented `Step11_Summary` component to display workshop results and provide a space for AI analysis and action planning via the `ChatInterface`.
- **Documentation:**
    - Updated `README.md` to reflect the current architecture, components, data flow, setup instructions, and workshop steps.
